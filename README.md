# Project Name

Star Wars DOM Array Methods

# Project Description

Javascript project that shows the name and height of a Star Wars character 
and allows the user to add a character, double the height, show only the 
shortest character, sort by the tallest character and totals the height of 
all the characters

# Why I Built It

Practice on creating objects and arrays and accessing the data in the
objects and arrays, even data that is nested. Being able to display the data
correctly. Pulling data from an API call and displaying certain items from 
the data.

# What I Would Do Next

I would add other attributes that are returned from the API such as the 
character's birth year, the number of films that shows the character, the starships the 
character used and the vehicles the character used.

# What I Learned

I learned that I need work with objects and arrays, especially those that
are nested. I need to break my code down into smaller steps and to write
psuedo code before I start actually coding. I also learned that not all 
arrays need to have a for loop used with them.

# How To Use It

Upon open of the page a single character is displayed. The user can add a 
character, double the character height, show only the short characters, sort 
the characters by the tallest and total the entire height of the characters.
